## Use-cases

**Planet** aims to answer certain (_personal_) problems.
It offers a collection of tools to meet certain goals, grouped 
into two categories.

### As an user 

- `Time tracking`: record the tasks performed during my free time 
  (to do, among other things, the analysis);
- `Reporting`: save, archive, share different kinds of things;
- `Blogging`: write articles, reports;
- `Interactive playgroud`, `sandboxing`: expose an execution context 
  for rich, locally executable applications
