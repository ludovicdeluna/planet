{1:index Planet}

[Planet] is a collection of tools to build an interactive playground
deployable on the web. All libraries form an ecosystem for describing
binaries and JavaScript bundles.

All source code is distributed under the [MIT] license.

The purpose of these tools is to cover these different issues / use cases:

- [Time-tracking]
- [Reporting]
- [Blogging]

The goal has not been to produce a generic generator, but to agree
with "my" needs.

The idea behind [Planet] is strongly inspired by the work of
{{: https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#home} Devine Lu Linvega}.

{2 Libraries}

- {{: Bedrock/index.html} Bedrock}: The library common to all others.
  It contains a collection of generic tools, compatible in the OS and
  in the web.

- {{: Paperwork/index.html} Paperwork}: Set of deserialization and
  serialization libraries for the formats used in [Planet].
  [Paperwork] is also agnostic of the execution context (OS or Web)
